# ESP Oxidized Sample Project

## Idea: custom Neopixel LED lamp

- a long diffused standing strip of Neopixels (and esp at the bottom) (actual form could be customizieable on etsy or smth)
- with app and many effects
  - alarm: rising sun/ flashing lights
  - night light: dimmed, soft, warm
  - party: strobe, rainbow, equalizer etc (maybe with built-in mic)
  - weather: rain, snow, thunderstorm, storm, sunny, cloudy, etc (requires internet connection)

### Setup

- connect to AP
- in app: put in wifi credentials
- esp connects to wifi, and sends new IP to app
- can now set up effects, via wifi
